# Lighthouse Labs- Intro to iOS

## Week 1, Day 2 - Storyboarding and ViewControllers

Class summary:

We covered storyboarding, and introduced the idea of view controllers.
View controllers have 4 main jobs:

    Set up and manage a hierarchy of views
    Decide how data is displayed
    Respond to user interaction in views
    Load any required data

We explored those topics in detail.

Then we talked about storyboarding, and how to lay out an app.

We also quickly covered one way of managing flow in a program, using an if and else blocks. These tools allow us to control the flow of our program by making decising based on the values of our data.
